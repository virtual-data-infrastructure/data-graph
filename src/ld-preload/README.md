# Directory for code employing `$LD_PRELOAD` to collect data traces

Employing `$LD_PRELOAD` will enable using the tools / libraries for augmenting or changing existing functionality to collect data traces.

Advantages:
- Can be used with existing systems.
- Good for development of envisioned features.

Disadvantages:
- Must be explicitly used, i.e., tracing functionality is not provided transparently.
